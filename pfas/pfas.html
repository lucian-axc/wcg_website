                <p>It involves a collaboration between WaterCare Guard, Syddansk Universitet and LightNovo ApS,
                    formalized in the Videnbroprojekt application of CLEAN Videnbro Ekspres

                <h5>Why...</h5>
                <p>PFAS environmental contaminations have in recent years come to cause great concern to public attention and governmental agencies due to their presence in numerous waterways, 
                    great persistence in the environment and ability to accumulate in and degrade living organisms. 
                    One major challenge of handling PFAS contaminations is the lack of a quick, accurate and cost-effective method for identifying these compounds on site; 
                    standard methods presume specialized laboratories and the time-consuming, costly transport of samples from the sites to them.

            <h2>Potential...</h2>
            <div class="description">
                <p> The projectâ€™s potential within markets associated with environmental technology and water quality management is significant, as public awareness towards the harmful effects of water pollution is rising and environmental regulations are getting stricter in regions like the EU and North America, increasing the demand for advanced environmental monitoring technology. Overall, the global market for PFAS detection and analysis is expected to reach DKK 913 million by 2024 and increase to DKK 1.5 billion by 2028. 
                    WaterCare Guard is in touch with potential customers and we are researching several potential sub-market applications to address first.

                <h5>How</h5>
                <hr>
                <p>Our project aims to solve the issue of faster, cheaper detection of PFAS contamination by creating an Internet of Things system which relies on the deployment of a mobile, compact device able to provide real-time measurements directly in the field. This will drastically reduce the time from sampling to viewing results and enable public or private agencies to take decisions much faster and continuously monitor water quality. This compact device utilizes Raman spectroscopy through an embedded miniature Raman spectrometer which communicates with a web application controlling the system and where data can be stored, 
                    as well as interpreted by machine learning algorithms to monitor, predict and better analyze the content of the liquid samples.

                <h5>Status</h5>
                <hr>
                <p>The project is in development from April to October 2024, laboratory studies have been started with the aim of designing a solution for filtration and surface functionalization, 
                    as well as lowering as much as possible the Limit of Detection for selected compounds
